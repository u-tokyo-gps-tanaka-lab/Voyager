async function mineCoalOre(bot) {
    // The function is focused on mining a single coal ore block using a wooden pickaxe if a coal ore block is found within a certain distance. It first searches for a coal ore block within a maximum distance of 32 blocks. If a coal ore block is located, it equips a wooden pickaxe from the inventory and proceeds to mine the coal ore block. If no coal ore block is found within the search range, it sends a message indicating the absence of coal ore.
