async function craftAndesite(bot) {
    // The function crafts andesite by first checking for a crafting table in the bot's inventory; if not found, it mines a birch log to craft one. Then, it determines a suitable position to place the crafting table and does so. After that, it checks for 1 diorite and 1 cobblestone in the inventory, mining them if not available. Finally, it crafts 1 andesite block using the gathered resources.
