async function craftIronChestplate(bot) {
    // The function crafts an iron chestplate by first ensuring the availability of a furnace and a crafting table. If the bot lacks a furnace, it mines cobblestone to craft one, placing it in a suitable position. Then, it smelts raw iron using coal as fuel. Similarly, if a crafting table is missing, the bot mines a birch log to craft one, placing it appropriately. Finally, it crafts an iron chestplate from the obtained iron ingots.
