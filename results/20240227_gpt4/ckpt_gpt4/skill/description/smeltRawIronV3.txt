async function smeltRawIron(bot) {
    // The function is about smelting raw iron into iron ingots using a furnace. It first checks if the bot has a furnace; if not, it mines 8 cobblestones to craft one. After obtaining the furnace, it finds a suitable position to place it and then proceeds to place the furnace at that location. Finally, it smelts raw iron using coal as fuel to produce iron ingots.
