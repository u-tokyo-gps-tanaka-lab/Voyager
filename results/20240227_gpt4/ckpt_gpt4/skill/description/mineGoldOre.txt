    // The function is about mining a single gold ore block using an iron pickaxe. It equips the iron pickaxe in the hand, then explores the surroundings until finding a gold ore block within a specified range. If a gold ore block is located, it mines the block and notifies the user that one gold ore has been mined; otherwise, it informs that no gold ore was found within the exploration range.
