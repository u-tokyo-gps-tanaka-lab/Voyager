async function craftIronPickaxe(bot) {
    // The function crafts an iron pickaxe by first checking for a furnace in the bot's inventory; if not found, it mines cobblestone to craft one. It then places the furnace and smelts raw iron using coal as fuel. Next, it checks for a crafting table; if absent, it mines a birch log to craft one, placing it afterward. Finally, it crafts an iron pickaxe from iron ingots and sticks.
