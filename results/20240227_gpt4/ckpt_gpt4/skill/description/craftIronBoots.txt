async function craftIronBoots(bot) {
    // The function crafts iron boots by first ensuring the availability of a furnace and crafting table. If the bot lacks a furnace, it mines cobblestone to craft one, then places and uses it to smelt raw iron with coal. Similarly, if a crafting table is missing, it mines birch log to craft one, then places it strategically. Finally, it crafts iron boots from the smelted iron ingots, ensuring the necessary tools and workstations are available for the process.
