async function craftWoodenPickaxe(bot) {
    // The function crafts a wooden pickaxe by first checking for a birch log in the bot's inventory and mining one if not available. It then crafts birch planks and sticks from the birch log, ensuring the presence of a crafting table by crafting one if needed.
