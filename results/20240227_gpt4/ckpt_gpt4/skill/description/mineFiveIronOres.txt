async function mineFiveIronOres(bot) {
    // The function is about mining 5 iron ores using either a stone pickaxe or an iron pickaxe. It first checks if the bot has a stone pickaxe or an iron pickaxe; if not, it mines 3 cobblestones and crafts a stone pickaxe. Then, it iterates through mining 5 iron ores by exploring until finding an iron ore within a certain range. If an iron ore is found, it equips the appropriate pickaxe and mines the iron ore, repeating the process for each of the 5 ores.
