    // The function crafts stone tools by first checking for a crafting table and exploring to find one if not available. It then ensures the presence of oak planks and oak logs by exploring and mining if necessary. Next, it checks for the required amount of stone and explores to find and mine it if needed. After ensuring an adequate supply of sticks through crafting, it places a crafting table, then crafts a stone pickaxe, axe, and shovel. Finally, it notifies the successful crafting of stone tools.
